# IMDB-SQLAnalysis
Analyzing IMDB Dataset and Hosting it in MySQL

Movies and TV Series have always been my favorite pastime. My first Data analysis project for GDAC was based on the Movie Industry dataset in Kaggle - How To Invest in Popular/Profitable Movies. There I had tried to 'decode' the formula for profitable movies using Excel and R - from movie runtime, popular writers/directors to ideal time of the year to release a movie - what made the movies more popular/profitable. For my first SQL project I wanted to go back to that, and extend it - IMDB has ratings for Movies, is it possible to derive ratings for directors/writers in a similar way?
